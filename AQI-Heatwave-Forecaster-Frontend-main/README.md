## Page Structure

1. Home Page

   
   ![chrome-capture-2023-2-3 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62760269/222749637-67691f0a-aba5-43fc-b55a-67dc3696d324.gif)


   Displays the monthly wise forecast for AQI and Heat wave occurence for the year of 2023 with necessary visualizations.The Best time series model for forecasting the results was based on RMSE and the description about the model chosen is provided. The evaluation metric displayed on the page is based on 25% of the data.
   

2. AQI

   ![chrome-capture-2023-2-3 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62760269/222746495-69447994-632e-4cfc-b2a1-3d5fb5de79f6.gif)


   Displays the Dynamic AQI Predictions monthly/Daily wise which is fetched from our back end API based on the model produced values returned by AWS scheduler. The page gets dynamically updated every day once the scheduler gets running. Forecasted values for the next 15 days/15 months is shown on the page with visualizations.
  

3. Temperature

   Displays the Dynamic Temperature Predictions monthly/Daily wise which is fetched from our back end API based on the model produced values returned by AWS scheduler. The page gets dynamically updated every day once the scheduler gets running. Forecasted values for the next 15 days/15 months is shown on the page with visualizations.
  

4. Live Dashboard
